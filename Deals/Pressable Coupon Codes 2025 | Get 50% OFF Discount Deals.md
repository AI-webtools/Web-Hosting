## Other Ways To Save On Pressable

In addition to amazing coupon codes and discounts, Pressable also offers other fantastic deals and savings opportunities.

Keep an eye out for their special promotions, such as:

### 1. Free Domain Name with Annual Hosting Plans

What It Is: Pressable provides a free domain name for the first year with annual hosting plans.

Details:

* Eligibility: Available for customers signing up for any annual hosting plan (e.g., Personal, Pro, or Agency). Monthly plans are typically excluded.
* Domain Types: Covers standard TLDs like .com, .org, .net, or .co. Premium TLDs (e.g., .ai, .tech) may not qualify or may cost extra.
* Limitations: May be restricted to specific plans or TLDs. Confirm terms to avoid surprises.

Who Benefits:

* New website owners need a domain.
* Small businesses or bloggers are committing to annual billing to reduce setup costs.

Example: On a Personal plan (~$20/month or $240/year), a free .com domain saves $15, lowering your first-year cost.

### 2. Free Site Migration Services

What It Is: Pressable transfers your existing WordPress site from another host to their platform for free.

Details:

* Scope: Includes moving WordPress files, databases, themes, plugins, and content. Ensures minimal downtime and functional continuity.
* Eligibility: Typically available to all new customers, regardless of plan. Some hosts limit free migrations (e.g., one site per account), so confirm with Pressable.
* Limitations: Complex sites (e.g., multisite setups or non-standard configurations) may require additional coordination. Confirm if multiple sites are covered.

Who Benefits:

* Users switching from hosts like Bluehost or SiteGround.
* Non-technical users are unfamiliar with manual migrations.
* Businesses or agencies are consolidating multiple sites.

Example: Migrating a 5GB blog from GoDaddy saves $100 in migration fees and hours of manual work.

### 3. Discounts for Non-Profit Organizations

What It Is: Pressable offers reduced hosting rates for registered nonprofit organizations.

Details:

* Eligibility: Available to 501(c)(3) organizations in the U.S. or equivalent nonprofit statuses globally. Requires verification (e.g., tax-exempt documentation).
* Discount: Typically 10â€“50% off standard plan prices, though exact rates vary.
* Limitations: Discounts may not combine with other promotions (e.g., coupons). Renewal rates should be confirmed.

Who Benefits:

* Nonprofits with tight budgets, like charities or community groups.
* Organizations building or maintaining WordPress sites for outreach.

Example: A nonprofit on the Pro plan (~$45/month or $540/year) with a 25% discount saves $135 annually.

### 4. Referral Program Rewards

What It Is: Pressable rewards customers for referring new clients to their hosting services.

Details:

* Structure: You receive a unique referral link or code. When someone signs up using it and becomes a paying customer, you earn a reward (e.g., account credit, cash, or discounts).
* Rewards: Likely $50â€“$100 in credit per referral, based on industry standards. Some programs offer tiered rewards (e.g., higher payouts for multiple referrals) or bonuses for referred customers (e.g., a discount on their first bill).
* Limitations: Rewards may have caps (e.g., max credit per year). Anti-fraud measures prevent self-referrals or fake signups.

Who Benefits:

* Bloggers, developers, or agencies with audiences likely to need hosting.
* Customers with networks of small businesses or freelancers.

Example: Referring three clients who sign up for annual plans earns $150 in credit, covering over half of a Personal planâ€™s cost.

By staying vigilant and taking advantage of these deals, you can maximize your savings while enjoying top-notch WordPress hosting from Pressable.
